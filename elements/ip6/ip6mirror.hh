IP6Mirror

swaps IP6 source and destination

=d

Incoming packets must have their IP6 header annotations set. Swaps packets'
source and destination IP6 addresses. Packets containing TCP or UDP
headers---that is, first fragments of packets with protocol 6 or 17---also
have their source and destination ports swapped.

The TCP or UDP checksums are not changed. They don't need to be; these
swap operations do not affect checksums.
