FromDPDKDevice(PORT [, QUEUE, N_QUEUES, I<keywords> PROMISC, BURST, NDESC])

=s netdevices

reads packets from network device using DPDK (user-level)

=d

Reads packets from the network device with DPDK port identifier PORT.

On the contrary to FromDevice.u which acts as a sniffer by default, packets
received by devices put in DPDK mode will NOT be received by the kernel, and
will thus be processed only once.

To use RSS (Receive Side Scaling) to receive packets from the same device
on multiple queues (possibly pinned to different Click threads), simply
use multiple FromDPDKDevice with the same PORT argument. Each
FromDPDKDevice will open a different RX queue attached to the same port,
and packets will be dispatched among the FromDPDKDevice elements that
you can pin to different thread using StaticThreadSched.

Arguments:

=over 20

=item PORT

Integer or PCI address. Port identifier of the device or a PCI address in the
format fffff:ff:ff.f

=item QUEUE

Integer. A specific hardware queue to use. Default is 0.

=item N_QUEUES

Integer. Number of hardware queues to use. -1 or default is to use as many queues
as threads assigned to this element.

=item PROMISC

Boolean. FromDPDKDevice puts the device in promiscuous mode if PROMISC is
true. The default is false.

=item BURST

Integer. Maximal number of packets that will be processed before rescheduling.
The default is 32.

=item MAXTHREADS

Integer. Maximal number of threads that this element will take to read packets from
the input queue. If unset (or negative) all threads not pinned with a
ThreadScheduler element will be shared among FromDPDKDevice elements and
other input elements supporting multiqueue (extending QueueDevice)

=item THREADOFFSET

Integer. Specify which Click thread will handle this element. If multiple
j threads are used, threads with id THREADOFFSET+j will be used. Default is
to share the threads available on the device's NUMA node equally.

=item NDESC

Integer. Number of descriptors per ring. The default is 256.

=item MAC

Colon-separated string. The device's MAC address.

=item MTU

Integer. The maximum transfer unit of the device.

=item MODE

String. The device's Rx mode. Can be none, rss, vmdq, vmdq_rss,
vmdq_dcb, vmdq_dcb_rss. For DPDK version >= 20.02, 'flow' is also
supported (DPDK's Flow API) if FastClick was built with --enable-flow-api.

=item FLOW_RULES_FILE

String. For DPDK version >= 20.02, FastClick was built with --enable-flow-api,
and if MODE is set to flow, a path to a file with Flow Rule Manager rules
can be supplied to the device. These rules are installed in the NIC using
DPDK's flow API.

=item FLOW_ISOLATE

Boolean. Requires MODE flow. Isolated mode guarantees that all ingress
traffic comes from defined flow rules only (current and future).
If ingress traffic does not match any of the defined rules, it will be
discarded by the NIC. Defaults to false.

=item VF_POOLS

Integer. The number of virtual function pools to be used by VMDq.

=item VF_VLAN

Vector of Integers. Contains the VLAN tags to be used for dispatching input
traffic using VLAN-based VMDq.

=item PAUSE

String. Set the device pause mode. "full" to enable pause frame for both
RX and TX, "rx" or "tx" to set one of them, and "none" to disable pause frames.
Do not set or choose "unset" to keep device current state/default.

=item ALLOW_NONEXISTENT

Boolean.  Do not fail if the PORT does not exist. If it's the case the task
will never run and this element will behave like Idle.

=item RSS_AGGREGATE

Boolean. If True, sets the RSS hash into the aggregate annotation
field of each packet. Defaults to False.

=item PAINT_QUEUE

Boolean. If True, sets the hardware queue number into the paint annotation
field of each packet. Defaults to False.

=item NUMA

Boolean. If True, allocates CPU cores in a NUMA-aware fashion.

=item NUMA_NODE

Integer. Specify the NUMA node to undertake packet processing.

=item RX_INTR

Integer. Enables Rx interrupts if non-negative value is given.
Defaults to -1 (no interrupts).

=item SCALE

String. Defines the scaling policy. Can be parallel or share.
Scaling is disabled by default.

=item TIMESTAMP

Boolean. Enables hardware timestamping. Defaults to false.

=item VLAN_FILTER

Boolean. Per queue ability to filter received VLAN packets by the hardware. Defaults to false.

=item VLAN_STRIP

Boolean. Per queue ability to strip VLAN header by the hardware in received VLAN packets. Defaults to false.

=item VLAN_EXTEND

Boolean. Per queue ability to extend VLAN tagged packets via QinQ. Defaults to false.

=item LRO

Boolean. Enables hardware-based Large Receive Offloading (LRO).
When set to true, the NIC coalesces consecutive frames of the same flow into larger frames.
Defaults to false.

=item JUMBO

Boolean. Enables the reception of Jumbo frames by the hardware. Defaults to false.

=item ACTIVE

Boolean. If False, the device is only initialized. Use this when you want
to read packet using secondary DPDK applications.

=item VERBOSE

Boolean. If True, more detailed messages about the device are printed to
the stdout. Defaults to False.

=back

This element is only available at user level, when compiled with DPDK
support.
