Repeated RecordTimestamp

Test the RecordTimestamp ecosystem (TimestampDiff, NumberPacket, ...) in
repeat mode, that is the crafted packets are replayed multiple time through
the same record timestamp. With OFFSET setted, RecordTimestamp should
loop in its internal array reading the timestamp number instead of growing.
