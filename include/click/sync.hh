/**
 * Duplicate a variable per-thread, allowing all threads to have their own
 * version of a variable. As opposed to __thread, any thread can also access
 * other thread's values using get/set_value_for_thread(), allowing proper
 * initialization and cleaning from the only thread calling elements
 * initialize and cleanup functions using a for loop from 0 to size().
 *
 * The class provides convenient functions, eg :
 * per_thread<int> my_int;
 *
 * my_int++;
 * my_int = my_int + 1;
 * int &a = *my_int; //Return a reference
 * a++; //Affect the per-thread variable
 *
 * per_thread<struct foo> my_foo;
 * my_foo->bar++;
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * The variable will be cached-align to avoid false sharing. This means that
 * the amount of bytes for each thread will be rounded up to 64 bytes. That
 * means that you should make per_thread of big structure of variables instead
 * of multiple per_threads.
 *
 * In other term, prefer to do :
 * struct state {
 *     int count;
 *     int drop;
 *     ...
 * }
 * per_thread<struct state> _state;
 *
 * Instead of : //this is the bad version
 * per_thread<int> _count; //do not copy-cut
 * per_thread<int> _drop; //do not do this
 * ...
