## Cross-disciplinary topics

### FastClick vs Click
An interesting example is to compare router-vanilla.click and router.click, which implement the basic Click router using respectively vanilla Click and FastClick to emphase the easier configuration in multiqueue + multithread context, perhaps the better improvement of FastClick after performances, but more difficult to show in the paper. Note that if you run router-vanilla on FastClick, the improvement made to Click core system will already improve the performances as opposed to running it in vanilla Click directly.
